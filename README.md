# EMIffect

EMI addon that appends status effects in EMI and provides information about each status effect.

Inspired by [Just Enough Effect Descriptions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-enough-effect-descriptions-jeed), and existing descriptions were taken from JEED.

Modders can add descriptions for their own status effects via language files. The format follows JEED: `effect.[mod_id].[effect_name].description`
